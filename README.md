# Steam game "10 minutes till dawn" Project
Welcome to my project, an innovative game project, our goal is to provide users with an interesting and challenging gaming environment
## How to Play
Use the keyboard to move the character and the mouse to control the shooting. A game needs to last for 10 minutes until dawn. During this period, you must avoid the monsters' hunting. You can choose to dodge the monsters' attacks with flexible movement, or you can pick up a gun and fight them to the end. More gameplay needs you to explore!
